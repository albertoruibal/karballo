/**
 * * info
 * the engine wants to send infos to the GUI. This should be done whenever one of the info has changed.
 * The engine can send only selected infos and multiple infos can be send with one info command,
 * e.g. "info currmove e2e4 currmovenumber 1" or
 * "info depth 12 nodes 123456 nps 100000".
 * Also all infos belonging to the pv should be sent together
 * e.g. "info depth 2 score cp 214 time 1242 nodes 2124 nps 34928 pv e2e4 e7e5 g1f3"
 * I suggest to start sending "currmove", "currmovenumber", "currline" and "refutation" only after one second
 * to avoid too much traffic.
 * Additional info:
 * * depth
 * search depth in plies
 * * seldepth
 * selective search depth in plies,
 * if the engine sends seldepth there must also a "depth" be present in the same string.
 * * time
 * the time searched in ms, this should be sent together with the pv.
 * * nodes
 * x nodes searched, the engine should send this info regularly
 * * pv  ...
 * the best line found
 * * multipv
 * this for the multi pv mode.
 * for the best move/pv add "multipv 1" in the string when you send the pv.
 * in k-best mode always send all k variants in k strings together.
 * * score
 * * cp
 * the score from the engine's point of view in centipawns.
 * * mate
 * mate in y moves, not plies.
 * If the engine is getting mated use negativ values for y.
 * * lowerbound
 * the score is just a lower bound.
 * * upperbound
 * the score is just an upper bound.
 * * currmove
 * currently searching this move
 * * currmovenumber
 * currently searching move number x, for the first move x should be 1 not 0.
 * * hashfull
 * the hash is x permill full, the engine should send this info regularly
 * * nps
 * x nodes per second searched, the engine should send this info regularly
 * * tbhits
 * x positions where found in the endgame table bases
 * * cpuload
 * the cpu usage of the engine is x permill.
 * * string
 * any string str which will be displayed be the engine,
 * if there is a string command the rest of the line will be interpreted as .
 * * refutation   ...
 * move  is refuted by the line  ... , i can be any number >= 1.
 * Example: after move d1h5 is searched, the engine can send
 * "info refutation d1h5 g6h5"
 * if g6h5 is the best answer after d1h5 or if g6h5 refutes the move d1h5.
 * if there is norefutation for d1h5 found, the engine should just send
 * "info refutation d1h5"
 * The engine should only send this if the option "UCI_ShowRefutations" is set to true.
 * * currline   ...
 * this is the current line the engine is calculating.  is the number of the cpu if
 * the engine is running on more than one cpu.  = 1,2,3....
 * if the engine is just using one cpu,  can be omitted.
 * If  is greater than 1, always send all k lines in k strings together.
 * The engine should only send this if the option "UCI_ShowCurrLine" is set to true.
